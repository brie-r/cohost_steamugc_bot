# Cohost Random Workshop Item Bot (WIP)

Will remain messy for a little while.

Uses reqwest and eggbug-rs to scrape steam workshop and post it to cohost.

Requires you to create a .env file with the following fields filled in
```
COHOST_EMAIL=your_email
COHOST_PASSWORD=your_password
COHOST_PROJECT=page_name_to_post_to (omit @)
APP_ID=number (steam app ID, eg 440 for TF2)
```
